Based on the information provided and my thorough analysis, here is the detailed cardiac assessment and recommendations:

**Prioritized Differential Diagnoses:**
1. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):** High likelihood.
   - **Rationale:** Symptoms such as rapid onset and termination of palpitations, combined with near-syncopal symptoms like dizziness, are characteristic of PSVT. The effectiveness of the Valsalva maneuver, a known terminating method for PSVT episodes, further supports this diagnosis.

2. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** Moderate likelihood.
   - **Rationale:** AF might cause similar episodes of rapid heart rate; however, absence of irregular rhythm description and partial symptom relief with Valsalva make AF less likely compared to PSVT.

3. **Anxiety or Panic Disorders:** Moderate likelihood.
   - **Rationale:** Stress-induced palpitations suggest a potential anxiety component. The presence of clear cardiac symptoms indicates a stronger cardiac etiology, yet anxiety should not be dismissed entirely.

4. **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):** Low likelihood.
   - **Rationale:** While PVCs might cause palpitations, they typically do not last long and are usually less intense unless occurring in frequent episodes.

**Identified Risk Factors and Significance:**
- **Caffeine Consumption:** Frequent caffeine intake could trigger palpitations in sensitive individuals, especially in those with underlying arrhythmic conditions.
- **Stress Levels:** High stress can exacerbate cardiac symptoms and might contribute to or trigger palpitations.
- **Lack of Previous Cardiac History:** Absence of previous cardiac conditions slightly reduces the likelihood of complex arrhythmias but does not eliminate the risk of current symptomatic arrhythmias.

**Urgency Assessment:**
- While symptoms are bothersome and require evaluation, they do not appear immediately life-threatening given the lack of syncope and chest pain, suggesting a moderate urgency for cardiac evaluation.

**Recommended Cardiac Tests or Monitoring:**
1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Initial assessment to detect arrhythmias.
2. **Holter Monitor:** 24-48 hour monitoring to identify transient arrhythmias during symptomatic episodes.
3. **Event Monitor:** Use for capturing infrequent episodes not detected during short-term Holter monitoring.
4. **Echocardiogram:** To assess structural heart health and rule out any underlying issues contributing to palpitations.

**Treatment Recommendations:**
1. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Reduction or elimination of caffeine intake.
   - Implement stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness or yoga.

2. **Referral:**
   - Strong recommendation for cardiologist follow-up to initiate a detailed workup and confirm diagnosis.

3. **Potential Medical Therapy:**
   - Depending on diagnostic findings, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers may be considered for symptomatic management of arrhythmias like PSVT.

**Follow-Up Requirements:**
- Schedule an urgent but non-emergency appointment with a cardiologist.
- Consider mental health evaluation if anxiety is partly suspected after cardiology workup, for potential management strategies.

This comprehensive answer ensures a detailed cardiac assessment encompassing specific diagnoses, recommended investigations, tailored treatment advice, and necessary follow-up, aiming at a holistic approach to the presented symptoms and risk factors in cardiac and non-cardiac considerations.
