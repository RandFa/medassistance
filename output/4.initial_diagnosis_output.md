Based on the provided information and my analysis, here is the detailed diagnostic assessment:

**Prioritized Differential Diagnoses:**
1. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):** High confidence
   - **Reasoning:** The sudden onset and termination of palpitations, along with near-syncope symptoms such as dizziness, suggest this. The effectiveness of the Valsalva maneuver also aligns with this condition.
   
2. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** Moderate confidence
   - **Reasoning:** AF can present similarly, especially with rapid heart rate episodes. However, the lack of irregular rhythm description and Valsalva maneuver effect make this less likely.

3. **Anxiety or Panic Disorders:** Moderate confidence
   - **Reasoning:** Symptoms exacerbated by stress and caffeine, along with no history of heart issues, point to a possible anxiety component. However, the clear physical manifestation suggests a more significant cardiac etiology.

4. **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):** Low confidence
   - **Reasoning:** PVCs could cause brief palpitations but typically don't last as long as described without causing more severe symptoms.

**Urgency Assessment:**
- The symptoms described warrant timely medical attention but are not immediately life-threatening since there is no chest pain or fainting.
- However, due to the impact on quality of life and potential for more serious underlying cardiac conditions, prompt evaluation and monitoring are advised.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Specialist Referral:**
   - Referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation is highly recommended.
   - Consider an ECG and possibly event monitoring to capture episodes and determine precise cardiac rhythm.
   - An echocardiogram may be warranted to rule out structural heart issues.

2. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Advise reducing caffeine intake to see if it lessens symptom frequency.
   - Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or counseling, might help if stress is a significant trigger.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Holter monitoring to capture asymptomatic episodes and correlate them with symptoms.
   - If anxiety is suspected post-evaluation, consider psychiatric assessment for anxiety disorders.

This comprehensive analysis considers the presenting symptoms, risk factors, and urgency level to prioritize potential diagnoses accurately. It ensures patient safety by suggesting specialist evaluation and provides actionable recommendations based on current symptoms and lifestyle factors.
