Doctor, I am experiencing a rapid and sudden palpitation of the heart, as if it is beating very fast for no apparent reason. This has been happening frequently for a few months and sometimes lasts for several minutes, occasionally more than an hour. When this occurs, I feel a slight dizziness, and sometimes shortness of breath, though it does not lead to fainting. It started about 6 months ago. I notice it often happens when I'm stressed or after drinking coffee or exercising, but sometimes it comes on suddenly even when I'm relaxed. Then it returns to normal suddenly. I have no previous history of heart disease, nor have I suffered from high blood pressure or diabetes. I do not take any medications daily, but occasionally I take painkillers for headaches like paracetamol. I do not smoke, but I drink coffee daily, about two to three cups. I do not consume alcohol. I do not feel chest pain, but at times when the palpitations are intense, I experience a slight shortness of breath and mild sweating. I have never lost consciousness. Sometimes when I hold my breath and try taking deep breaths, the palpitations ease a little. I read about the Valsalva maneuver and tried it, and sometimes it helps stop the episode.
