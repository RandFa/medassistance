Privacy-Compliant Medical Text:
Doctor, I am experiencing a rapid and sudden palpitation of the heart, as if it is beating very fast for no apparent reason. This has been happening frequently for several months and sometimes lasts for several minutes, occasionally more than an hour. When this occurs, I feel a slight dizziness, and sometimes shortness of breath, though it does not lead to fainting. It started about [TIMEFRAME REDACTED]. I notice it often happens when I'm stressed or after drinking coffee or exercising, but sometimes it comes on suddenly even when I'm relaxed. Then it returns to normal suddenly. I have no previous history of heart disease, nor have I suffered from high blood pressure or diabetes. I do not take any medications daily, but occasionally I take painkillers for headaches like paracetamol. I do not smoke, but I drink coffee daily, about two to three cups. I do not consume alcohol. I do not feel chest pain, but at times when the palpitations are intense, I experience a slight shortness of breath and mild sweating. I have never lost consciousness. Sometimes when I hold my breath and try taking deep breaths, the palpitations ease a little. I read about the Valsalva maneuver and tried it, and sometimes it helps stop the episode.
